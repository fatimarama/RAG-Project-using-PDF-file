# Project Description
This project demonstrates the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to create a powerful information retrieval system, by using embeddings generated from a PDF book. By combining state-of-the-art models for embedding generation and retrieval, this project aims to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the generated responses.

## Key Components:
### 1. PDF Book Embeddings:
  - Source: A comprehensive PDF book used to generate embeddings.
  - Embedding Models:
    - Groq: Utilized for high-performance embedding generation.
    - all-MiniLM-L6-v2: A lightweight model for creating efficient and effective embeddings.
    - Llama-3.1-70b-versatile: A versatile model employed for high-quality embeddings.
